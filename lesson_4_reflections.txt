1. WHEN MIGHT YOU WANT TO ALWAYS PULL CHANGES MANUALLY RATHER THAN HAVING GIT 
AUTOMATICALLY STAY UP-TO-DATE WITH YOUR REMOTE REPOSITORY?

when you do not need data from other people's work on the remote to do 
your programming locally.
by pulling changes manually you can commit your work locally first and push
your changes when ready.

2. DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FORKS, CLONES AND BRANCHES
WHEN WOULD YOU USE ONE INSTEAD OF ANOTHER

Fork: 
- differs from clone in that fork is a GitHub-only action. 
- differs from branch in that fork encompasses entire repository
- Usage: 
start from someone else's work to customize and make your personal project.

Clone:
- differs from fork in that it can apply to local repositories, or
remote and local repositories outside of GitHub
- differs from branch in tat it encompasses entire repository
- Usage: like Fork, but available outside of GitHub also.

Branch:
- differs from fork and clone in that it includes only a subset of all commits, related
to one specific part of a project / bug / feature etc.
- usage: when changing context or topic inside a project, a new branch is created.

3. WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A COPY OF THE LAST KNOWN STATE OF THE
REMOTE STORED LOCALLY?

It enables you to do offline work on a local branch with all of the recent changes
on the remote available, up to the point where you went offline

1. HOW DO THE DIAGRAMS HELP YOU VISUALIZE THE BRANCH STRUCTURE?

Diagrams show all commits belonging to each of the individual branches, and show their common
node point. They also show any commits not included in a branch, hence unreachable

2. WHAT IS THE RESULT OF MERGING TWO BRANCHES TOGETHER? WHY DO WE REPRESENT IT IN THE DIAGRAM
THE WAY WE DO?

As a result of merging, all of the commits inside the merged branch will be inserted chronologically
into the merging-into-branch. All of the commits of this last one will be kept.
The new branch label will be set to the label of the merging-into-branch.

Git command:
1. (explicit) git merge branch1 branch2: branch2 will be merged into branch1
2. (implicit) git merge branch2: when branch1 is checked-out, branch1 will always be included
into the merge operation

3. WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS OF GIT AUTOMATIC MERGING VS ALWAYS MERGING MANUALLY?
automatic merging is faster
manual merging looks at logical content of changes to make judgements about 
changes to be kept as final version


Cheers!

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	when collaborating

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	manual pull allows you to form logically coherent units instead
of random units determined by set time intervals

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

fork: a copy of a repository kept for making personal changes to code, and
develop an independent project from that starting point.
May or may not be accepted back into the original code van the author
(accepting a so-called "pull request").

clone: download the entire remote repository to local computer, including all commits 
in their present state. A clone serves to add code locally, with the goal of
merging it with the remote repository

branch: a part of a repository consisting of all commits relating to a particular
work task / code logic

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
	When going offline, you will able to continue working on the most up to date 
	version

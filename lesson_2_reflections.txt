1. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INITIALIZE A REPOSITORY?
WHY DO YOU NEED TO DO IT?

Git adds a .git directory and adds meta data to the working directory. You need the meta data 
to start tracking file changes

2. HOW IS THE STAGING AREA DIFFERENT FROM THE WORKING DIR AND THE REPO?
WHAT VALUE DOES IT OFFER

Difference from working dir: it is tracked by Git
Difference form repo: it containes changes not yet committed
Value: evaluate which changes justify which (or many) commits

3. HOW CAN YOU USE THE STAGING AREA TO ENSURE ONE COMMIT PER LOGICAL CHANGE?
When comparing differences between staging area and commit (using "git diff --staged"), 
one can evaluate is one or more logical changes occured.


Cheers!
